<p>If during the performance of any rock group the electricity on the stage is suddenly disconnected, the show is over. And, as a rule, not on the best terms. And only musicians of the ILUZHAN band won’t even notice the current failure. The 99% acoustic music created by this band will sound good as well on a festival big-stage, as in a close round of a home concert. And the sound will be always almost equally – with electricity or without it – fresh, uncommonly, lyrically, atmospherically and energetically. The grace of classical strings and the clarinet is skillfully weaved with a velvet groove of the rocking rhythm section, masterful passages of the acoustic guitar and Latin enthusiasm of percussion, and all together they border with itself the flying and touching female voice, a mezzo-soprano, telling stories about love and something more in different languages and pouring with shades of folk, soviet retro, afro-jazz and soul... It’s better to hear it once…<p>ILUZHAN reckons the existence since November 11, 2011. Since then the band has created more than 30 songs on Jekaterina Popova\'s texts, a lot of instrumental music, a quantity of cover versions on the most unexpected hits among which – the adored cover on the song by Nino Katamadze "Once in the street". With the permission of Nino Katamadze, ILUZHAN performs this song in Belarusian under the name "Adnoychy na vulitsy". The band has made a set of records – audio and video, and only the few from them have been taken out on court of listeners because of strict selection. ILUZHAN tirelessly experiments to this day with studio sounding, dreams of shooting of the clip and prepares the second part of an album trilogy "Tsi Tchuesh" for release.</p>
<p>In creation of music the band essentially doesn\'t pursue commercial interests, being guided exclusively by own musical preferences of the band members and the acquired concert experience. The main mission of the band is, to present to the listeners qualitative original music in the native language, to give esthetic pleasure to admirers and friends, to transfer to the public the vibrations of pleasure and freedom of collective creativity, to help the listener to re-experience dramatic emotions beautifully and to become reloaded with pure, positive energy.</p>
<p>The band happened to participate in events of the most various scale – from a performance in a military tent in the rain on the bank of the forest lake to an hour set at the big festival «Volnaye Pavetra». Musicians of the ILUZHAN band are ready to share their music as well in a small cafe – in the cut-down purely acoustic structure with percussion instead of drums, as in a large auditorium – in this case, a back vocal and keyboards can organically join the band. Thus, the number of musicians on a performance can vary from two to ten people. In the majority of performances, the band consists of the rhythm section, the acoustic guitar with effects, the violin, the violoncello, the clarinet and the vocal – this is the most effective and mobile option. The band has visited different cities of Belarus, and will be glad to new invitations, including neighbouring countries and beyond, guaranteeing a responsible approach to any offer.</p>
<p>ILUZHAN is eager for new rise of creativity in our country, new blossoming of the Belarusian modern musical culture – original and at the same time not isolated, clear and highly artistic. The band steadily seeks to be improved, without forgetting at the same time, that the best thing is, that speaks to the heart. The musicians are inspired not only by the skill of modern foreign stars and recognized local talents, but also by the classic of different periods, songs of our senior generations, dialects of small villages, melodics of native nature and the pulse of Minsk.</p>
<p>The creativity of the band is intended to convince listeners that sincerity is beautiful, joy is natural, love is unconditional.</p>
